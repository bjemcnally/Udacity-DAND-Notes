# CONTROL FLOW: INTRODUCTION

'''
conditional statements and loops
    Boolean expressions
    for and while loops
    break and continue to exit or skip loops
    helpful built in functions (e.x. zip and enumerate)
    list comprehensions
'''

# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

'''
if statements run or skip indented code based upon whether a statement is TRUE or FALSE 
'''

if phone_balace < 5:
        phone_balance += 10
        bank_balance -=

'''
if, elif, and else

elif evaluates if previous if is false. you can have multiple elif blocks to handle different situations

indentation, multiples of four (4) spaces

# Quiz

points = 174  # use this input when submitting your answer

# write your if statement here
if points <= 50:
    result = "Congratulations! You won a wooden rabbit!"
elif points <= 150:
    result = "Oh dea, no prize this time."
elif points <= 180:
    result = "Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!"
elif prize <= 200:
    result = "Congratulations! You won a pengiun!"

print(result)

'''
Note: Lower bounds of comparison operators are not required because previous statement would apply if points was <50, etc.
